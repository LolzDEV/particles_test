# Particles Test [![Project Status: Active â€“ The project has reached a stable, usable state and is being actively developed.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/active.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#active)

### :warning: This is a test!
This is not supposed to be a playable game, it's just a test made by me for fun and for trying creating something concrete with the Rust Programming Language

### PRs are welcome
As I said before this is just a test but if you like it and you want to contribute or modify the game, feel free to do it! Isn't this the coolest part of OpenSource?

### Usage

There are a few controls:

- **P**: pauses/unpauses the game
- **R**: resets the world
- **Esc**: closes the game
- **RMB**: erases the particles in the brush area
- **LMB**: spawns selected particle in the brush area
- **1**: selects *sand* as current particle 
- **2**: selects *wood* as current particle 

There are also only 2 types of particles (at the moment):
- **Sand**: This particle is subjected to "real" sand physics
- **Wood**: This particle is just static, it can be used as floor or containment for sand
